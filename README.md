# Heart-Disease-Prediction
### Overview
This project analyzes heart disease data to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using various machine learning models. <br> The dataset contains clinical and demographic features, which are used to build predictive models. The project demonstrates the entire data analysis workflow, from preprocessing to model evaluation.
<br>
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical attributes and target labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
<br>
Attributes Include:
Age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and more.

### Conclusion 
The project provides predictions on heart disease and identifies the most important features contributing to the predictions. The model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test set.
